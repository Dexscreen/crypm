<p>ASIC and GPU mining serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:</p>

<h4>ASIC Mining:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Designed specifically for one algorithm (usually Bitcoin SHA-256)</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Extremely high hash rate and energy efficiency</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Can only mine specific cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $2,000-5,000 per unit</li>
    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Higher potential profits but less flexible</li>
</ul>

<h4>GPU Mining:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> General-purpose graphics cards that can mine various algorithms</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Can switch between different cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li><strong>Resale Value:</strong> GPUs retain value for gaming and other uses</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $300-1,500 per GPU</li>
    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Lower individual profits but more adaptable</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose ASIC mining for Bitcoin focus and maximum efficiency, or GPU mining for flexibility and lower entry costs.</p>
