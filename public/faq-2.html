<p>Cryptocurrency mining electricity consumption varies significantly by hardware type:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ASIC Bitcoin Miners:</strong> 3,000-3,500 watts (72-84 kWh daily)</li>
    <li><strong>GPU Mining Rig (6 cards):</strong> 1,200-1,800 watts (29-43 kWh daily)</li>
    <li><strong>Single GPU:</strong> 200-350 watts (5-8 kWh daily)</li>
    <li><strong>CPU Mining:</strong> 65-150 watts (1.5-3.6 kWh daily)</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison, an average US household uses about 30 kWh daily. A single ASIC miner uses 2-3 times more electricity than an entire home. This is why electricity cost is the primary factor determining mining profitability.</p>
<p>Many profitable mining operations are located in regions with cheap renewable energy, such as hydroelectric power in Washington State or geothermal energy in Iceland.</p>
